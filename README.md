# Guided Buying Recommender (GBR) System

<b>AI-powered procurement recommendation system demonstrating vector search and multi-agent architecture for enterprise purchasing decisions.</b>

![enterprise-grade-search](https://github.com/Pratik872/Guided-Buying-System-PineCone/blob/main/readme_resources/grade-search.png)

## Demo Results
### Search Performance
- <b>50,000 products</b> indexed and searchable
- <b>Sub-200ms</b> query response time
- <b>Semantic Similarity</b> scoring

### Recommendation Quality
- <b>Bundle Recommendations</b>: 3 intelligent bundles per search
- <b>Alternative Products</b>: Similar items within budget
- <b>Cost Optimization</b>: Average 5% bundle savings
- <b>Business Compliance</b>: 100% budget adherence

## Performance Metrics
### Search Latency
- <b>Average Query Time</b>: 139ms (vector search + NER + filtering)
- <b>Index Size</b>: 50K products with metadata
- <b>Embedding Generation</b>: less 50ms per query
- <b>Business Logic Processing</b>: less than 10ms

### Business Capabilities
- <b>Budget Optimization</b>: Role-based filtering and recommendations
- <b>Bundle Intelligence</b>: Automatic accessory suggestions with savings calculation
- <b>Alternative Discovery</b>: Similar product recommendations

### MLOPs & Production
- <b>Container Startup</b>: ~15 seconds including model loading
- <b>CI/CD Runtime</b>: ~2 minutes for full test and build cycle
- <b>Health Monitoring</b>: Automated status validation
- <b>Production Ready</b>: Dockerized with automated testing

## MODULAR Project Structure
